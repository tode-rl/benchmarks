# Sponsorship

ComputeSDK Benchmarks is an independent project that provides transparent, reproducible performance data for cloud sandbox providers. Sponsorship supports ongoing operations and enables large-scale testing.

## Why Sponsor?

**For the ecosystem**: Developers deserve objective performance data when choosing infrastructure. Your sponsorship funds independent measurement that benefits everyone.

**For your company**: Participation in a credible, third-party benchmark demonstrates confidence in your product and provides ongoing performance visibility.

## What Sponsorship Includes

### Benchmark Participation

- Your provider included in daily automated benchmarks
- Results published alongside all other providers
- Historical data tracked over time
- Listed on benchmarks.computesdk.com (launching Q2 2026)

### Quarterly Stress Tests

Starting Q2 2026, sponsors participate in large-scale concurrency tests:

- **10,000 concurrent sandbox** creation and execution
- Reliability metrics under load
- P50/P95/P99 latency distributions
- Results published in quarterly reports

### Technical Integration

- We implement and maintain the SDK integration for your provider
- Direct line to our engineering team for integration questions
- Early access to new benchmark categories before public release

## What Sponsorship Does NOT Include

To maintain credibility, sponsors **cannot**:

- Influence benchmark methodology
- Preview or edit results before publication
- Remove unfavorable results
- Receive preferential test conditions

All providers are tested with identical methodology. Results reflect actual measured performance.

## Pricing

- Billed quarterly ($30,000/quarter)
- Annual commitment available at $100,000/year (2 months free)

## FAQ

**Q: Can we run benchmarks from our own infrastructure?**

A: Our published results run from GitHub Actions for consistency. You're welcome to run the open-source benchmark locally to verify our methodology.

**Q: What if our performance is slower than competitors?**

A: Results are published as measured. Many factors affect TTI, and slower providers often have other strengths (features, pricing, reliability). We recommend using benchmark participation as motivation to optimize cold-start performance.

**Q: Can we see results before they're published?**

A: No. Results are published automatically via CI. We don't manually review or gate results.

**Q: What if we find a bug in the benchmark code?**

A: Please open a GitHub issue or email us. We'll investigate and fix legitimate bugs. If a bug affected published results, we'll publish corrected data.

**Q: Can we sponsor without being benchmarked?**

A: No. Sponsorship and benchmark participation are bundled. We don't accept sponsorship from providers who don't want their performance measured.

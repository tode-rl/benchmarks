# Sponsorship

ComputeSDK Benchmarks is becoming the industry standard for measuring sandbox performance.

## Provider Sponsorship

For sandbox providers who want to demonstrate their platform performance.

### Free vs Sponsor

**Daily TTI benchmarks are free.** Any provider can submit a PR to be included in our daily Time to Interactive tests. We'll review and merge integrations that meet our technical requirements.

**Provider sponsor tests are sponsor-only.** These are additional benchmark categories that require significant infrastructure or ongoing investment to run. Provider sponsors fund these tests and are included in them.

#### Current Provider Sponsor Tests

**Quarterly Stress Test** — 10,000+ concurrent sandbox creation. Measures performance under real-world pressure: reliability at scale, P50/P95/P99 latencies, failure rates. Results published in quarterly reports.

#### Coming Soon

We're continuously developing new benchmark categories. Provider sponsors are automatically included in all future tests as they launch.

- **Warm start performance** — Snapshots, templates, pre-warmed pools
- **Multi-region latency** — US, EU, Asia
- **Cost efficiency** — $ per sandbox-minute
- **Long-running stability** — Hours-long session reliability
- **Resource scaling** — CPU/memory performance under load

### Why Become a Provider Sponsor?

Daily TTI shows best-case, one-at-a-time performance. Provider sponsor tests show how your platform performs when it matters—at scale, under load, in real-world conditions. That's what sophisticated buyers care about.

### What Provider Sponsors Get

**Benchmark inclusion** — Inclusion in all provider sponsor-only benchmark categories.

**Logo & badge** — Your logo on benchmarks.computesdk.com and in quarterly reports. Plus a "ComputeSDK Benchmarked" badge to use on your own site.

**Technical integration** — We build and maintain your SDK integration. You provide API access, we handle the rest.

**Priority support** — Direct line for integration questions and early access to new benchmark categories.

### What Provider Sponsors Don't Get

Provider sponsors **cannot** influence results. Period.

- No preview before publication
- No editing unfavorable results
- No preferential test conditions
- No methodology input

All providers are tested identically. Results reflect actual measured performance.

### Provider Pricing

**$10,000/month**

- Billed quarterly ($30,000/quarter)
- Annual: $100,000/year (2 months free)

## FAQ

**What if we're a provider and slower than competitors?**

Results are published as measured. Use it as motivation to optimize.

**Can we see benchmark results before they go live?**

No. Results publish automatically via CI.

**Can providers sponsor without being benchmarked?**

No. If you don't want to be measured, we don't want your money.

**Can partners influence which providers you recommend?**

No. We provide data and analysis, but we don't make recommendations. You decide what's best for your use case.

**Do partners get access to raw benchmark data?**

Partners get detailed reports with aggregated data. Raw data access is available by request for specific use cases.

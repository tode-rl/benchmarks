# Sponsorship

ComputeSDK Benchmarks is becoming the industry standard for measuring sandbox performance.

## Free vs Sponsor

**Daily TTI benchmarks are free.** Any provider can submit a PR to be included in our daily Time to Interactive tests. We'll review and merge integrations that meet our technical requirements.

**Sponsor tests are sponsor-only.** These are additional benchmark categories that require significant infrastructure or ongoing investment to run. Sponsors fund these tests and are included in them.

### Current Sponsor Tests

**Quarterly Stress Test** — 10,000+ concurrent sandbox creation. Measures performance under real-world pressure: reliability at scale, P50/P95/P99 latencies, failure rates. Results published in quarterly reports.

### Coming Soon

We're continuously developing new benchmark categories. Sponsors are automatically included in all future tests as they launch.

- **Warm start performance** — Snapshots, templates, pre-warmed pools
- **Multi-region latency** — US, EU, Asia
- **Cost efficiency** — $ per sandbox-minute
- **Long-running stability** — Hours-long session reliability
- **Resource scaling** — CPU/memory performance under load

## Why Sponsor?

Daily TTI shows best-case, one-at-a-time performance. Sponsor tests show how you perform when it matters—at scale, under load, in real-world conditions. That's what sophisticated buyers care about.

## What Sponsors Get

**Sponsor tests** — Inclusion in all sponsor-only benchmark categories.

**Logo & badge** — Your logo on benchmarks.computesdk.com and in quarterly reports. Plus a "ComputeSDK Benchmarked" badge to use on your own site.

**Technical integration** — We build and maintain your SDK integration. You provide API access, we handle the rest.

**Priority support** — Direct line for integration questions and early access to new benchmark categories.

## What Sponsors Don't Get

Sponsors **cannot** influence results. Period.

- No preview before publication
- No editing unfavorable results
- No preferential test conditions
- No methodology input

All providers are tested identically. Results reflect actual measured performance.

## Pricing

- Billed quarterly ($30,000/quarter)

## FAQ

**What if we're slower than competitors?**

Results are published as measured. Use it as motivation to optimize.

**Can we see results before they go live?**

No. Results publish automatically via CI.

**Can we sponsor without being benchmarked?**

No. If you don't want to be measured, we don't want your money.

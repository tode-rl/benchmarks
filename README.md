**TTI (Time to Interactive)** = API call to first command execution. Lower is better.

<br>

## What We Measure

**Daily: Time to Interactive (TTI)**

```
API Request → Provisioning → Boot → Ready → First Command
└───────────────────── TTI ─────────────────────┘
```

Each benchmark creates a fresh sandbox, runs `echo "benchmark"`, and records wall-clock time. 10 iterations per provider, every day, fully automated.

**Powered by ComputeSDK** — We use [ComputeSDK](https://github.com/computesdk/computesdk), a multi-provider SDK, to test all sandbox providers with the same code. One API, multiple providers, fair comparison. Interested in multi-provider failover, sandbox packing, and warm pooling? [Check out ComputeSDK](https://github.com/computesdk/computesdk).

**Sponsor-only tests coming soon:** Stress tests, warm starts, multi-region, and more. [See roadmap →](#roadmap)
